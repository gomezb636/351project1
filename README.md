To execute:

1. Run make file by typing "make"
2. Execute ./r
3. Execute ./s keyfile.txt
4. "Message Received" will display
5. recvfile will be generated and will contain the message "Hello world".

We have included the recvfile generated when we ran it; when testing our code,
you can delete the recvfile and executable files and do steps written above to
verify that it works properly.
